So Sumus document was provided just for reference because we need the similar for that, but not Sumus, but Octily. And use the Octily admin panel ClaudeMD.\"\n\n## Interpretation\nUser clarified that SUMMUS PDF was only a functional reference for POS terminal features. The branding should be Octili \\(green/teal palette\\) matching the Admin Panel, not SUMMUS \\(dark blue/orange\\).\n\n## Actions Taken\n- Updated index.css with Octili brand colors \\(green #24BD68, teal #00A77E, etc.\\)\n- Rewrote LoginPage.tsx with Octili branding and colors\n- Updated CLAUDE.md with Octili brand guidelines\n- Mirrored changes to AGENTS.md and GEMINI.md\n\n## Files Changed\n- `src/index.css` - Changed colors from SUMMUS \\(blue/orange\\) to Octili \\(green/teal\\)\n- `src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx` - Updated branding, colors, logo reference\n- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated brand guidelines section\n- `AGENTS.md` - Mirrored from CLAUDE.md\n- `GEMINI.md` - Mirrored from CLAUDE.md\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
